# Pesticide Intake in plant body
In this present study, we investigated the intake transport phenomena of pesticide species 
in the Moong plant body utilizing droplet evaporation dynamics in a Goniometer. Different 
concentration of pesticide droplet was applied to the leaves of three different aged plants 
in order to investigate pesticide droplet features and uptake time. The water potential of the 
leaf was assessed in order to estimate the pressure gradient. The water content and porosity 
of leaf, stem, and root were assessed in order to create an experimentally based 3D 
numerical model of pesticide intake in plant body. Pesticide droplet evaporation duration 
was significantly reduced in high concentration pesticide droplets. Water potential and 
content vary depending on the age of the plant. The porosity of various plant body 
components was larger in 40-day-old plants, which had a major impact on increased 
pesticide intake from leaf to stem. Pesticide droplet intake velocity was high at higher 
concentrations, which was aided by the older plant's porous structure. Numerical modelling 
demonstrated that pesticide absorption is mostly determined by concentration and porosity 
of plant body. In order to reduce contamination-free crop production, less concentrated 
pesticide application is strongly recommended. Another major finding of the current study 
is that pesticide residue is present in plant body parts following droplet evaporation, 
regardless of concentration, porosity and age. It was suggested that using environmentally 
friendly organic pesticides for pesticide-free food production in the future would be far 
superior for sustainable agriculture practices without jeopardizing global food security.
